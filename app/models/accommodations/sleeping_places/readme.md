-   `accommodation_id`: Foreign key referencing the `accommodations` table.

**Relationships**:

-   `sleeping_place`: Links to the `SleepingPlace` model.
-   `accommodation`: Links to the `Accommodation` model.

**Example**:

```python
accommodation_sleeping_place = AccommodationSleepingPlace(
    sleeping_place_id=1,
    accommodation_id=2
)
print(accommodation_sleeping_place)
# Output: <AccommodationSleepingPlace(id=1, sleeping_place_id=1, accommodation_id=2)>
```

### 3. `sleeping_place.py`
