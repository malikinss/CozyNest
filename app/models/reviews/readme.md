# Reviews Directory üì¶

The `reviews` directory provides the implementation of the `Review` model, which represents guest reviews for accommodations.
It includes features like ratings, comments, and timestamps to track feedback on accommodations.

## Directory Structure üìÇ

```plaintext
reviews/
|---- __init__.py
|---- review.py
```

## Modules Overview üìù

### 1. `__init__.py`

The initializer for the `reviews` module, enabling the `Review` class to be imported directly.

**Exports**:

-   `Review`

**Example**:

```python
from reviews import Review
```

### 2. `review.py`

Defines the `Review` class, which models reviews provided by guests.

**Features**:

-   Links reviews to guests (`User`) and accommodations (`Accommodation`) via foreign keys.
-   Captures review details such as rating, comment, and creation timestamp.

**Attributes**:

-   `id`: Primary key of the review.
-   `accommodation_id`: Foreign key referencing the `accommodations` table.
-   `guest_id`: Foreign key referencing the `users` table.
-   `rating`: Rating given by the guest (1 to 5).
-   `comment`: Optional feedback text.
-   `created_at`: Timestamp indicating when the review was created.

**Relationships**:

-   `accommodation`: Links to the `Accommodation` model.
-   `guest`: Links to the `User` model.

**Constraints**:

**Example**:

```python
review = Review(
    accommodation_id=1,
    guest_id=2,
    rating=5,
    comment="Amazing stay!"
)
print(review)
# Output: <Review(id=1, accommodation_id=1, guest_id=2, rating=5,
# comment='Amazing stay!', created_at=2024-12-01)>
```
