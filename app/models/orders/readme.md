# Orders Directory üì¶

The `orders` directory implements the `Order` model, which manages guest orders for accommodations in the booking system.
This model tracks essential details such as pricing, dates, and guest information.

## Directory Structure üìÇ

```plaintext
orders/
|---- __init__.py
|---- order.py
```

## Modules Overview üìù

### 1. `__init__.py`

The module initializer for the `orders` package. It exports the `Order` class for direct import from the package.

**Exports**:

-   `Order`

**Example**:

```python
from orders import Order
```

### 2. `order.py`

Defines the `Order` class, which models a guest order in the booking system.

**Features**:

-   Links orders to guests (`User`) and accommodations (`Accommodation`) via foreign keys.
-   Tracks important details such as pricing, stay dates, and guest count.

**Attributes**:

-   `id`: Primary key of the order.
-   `accomodation_id`: Foreign key referencing the `accomodations` table.
-   `guest_id`: Foreign key referencing the `users` table.
-   `total_price`: Total price for the booking.
-   `date_checkin`: Check-in date for the order.
-   `date_checkout`: Check-out date for the order.
-   `people_amount`: Number of people included in the booking.
-   `confirmation_code`: A unique confirmation code for the booking.

**Relationships**:

-   `accomodation`: Links to the `Accomodation` model.
-   `guest`: Links to the `User` model.

**Constraints**:

-   `people_amount` must be greater than 0.

**Example**:

```python
order = Order(
    accomodation_id=1,
    guest_id=2,
    total_price=250.00,
    date_checkin="2024-12-10",
    date_checkout="2024-12-15",
    people_amount=3,
    confirmation_code="CONF12345"
)
print(order)
# Output: <Order(id=1, accomodation_id=1, guest_id=2, total_price=250.00,
# dates=(2024-12-10 to 2024-12-15), people=3)>
```
